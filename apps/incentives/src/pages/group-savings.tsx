              Create a multisig with the people you want to save with. This can easily be done with

              <ResourceLink href='https://www.party.app/'>Party App</ResourceLink>. While the number
              of users can change, always make sure to require more than 1 signature to make any
              transactions!

            <li>
              Get everyone to pitch in some amount of tokens, and transfer them to the multisig.
            </li>
            <li>
              Convene and pick the prize vault(s) you would like to deposit in, and make the
              deposits from the multisig.
            </li>
            <li>
              As the group wins prizes, these will roll into the multisig, and the group can decide
              what to do with them.
